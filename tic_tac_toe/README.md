# Tic Tac Toe

## Running
	
	# PS. Execute this command and wait some time,
	# the code it's creating the game tree and learning.
	python3 main.py

## Notes

* Creates and train the agent, but it's necessary a lot of time to proper train the agent, because
the way that I made it's using a game tree, so this means that the agent will be good, but need
to play in a lot of states to get execelent.

* The implementation it's also greedy, only greedy, one possibility to improve learn it's to use
e-greedy.

* If you play againt him, it will also learn.
